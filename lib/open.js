/*
	This wrapper was done for upgrading the module "open" from v8 to v10, since this module is now ESM-only
	(which makes ZERO sense for a Node.js-only module, but well...).
	But Electronjs does not support ESM until v28 released december 2023.
	But even Electronjs v28 crashes when trying to dynamicly import() "open".

	So... for instance we will be using the older "open" v8.4.2 until it finally works in Electronjs (and there are
	good reasons not to use Electronjs own shell open).

	Or I will forks "open" to turn it into CJS again.
